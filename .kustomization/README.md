# Kustomization

This directory contains the ```kubernetes``` resource manifests that provide a description on the different components
for this project. To do so, it resorts to ```kustomize```, a tool that allows the management of ```kubernetes```
resource objects using ```kustomization.yaml``` files.

More information on that is found in ```kubernetes```
documentation, [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/)

## Directory structure

In the root location, 3 directories are found:

* base: ```kubernetes``` resources that serve as a base for other components
* components: ```kubernetes``` components that are put together by each overlay
* overlays: high level object that represent an environment and defines a combination of bases and components

## Secret management

The need to have the repository under version control has led to the challenge of having storing sensitive information
in the remote repository, in this case, ```kubernetes``` secrets. This is where ```bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets``` comes
in, a tool that encrypts secrets so that one can safely store this information remotely. For instructions on how to
install & use, visit its documentation [here](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
.

The idea is then converting regular ```kubernetes``` secrets into sealed secrets. Regular secrets are hidden files,
like ```.secrets.yaml``` and, in **no** circumstance, should they be committed to git repository. A rule
in ```.gitignore``` should prevent it from happening and is present for that reason. Sealed secrets are not hidden
files, like ```sealed.yaml``` and is safe to store in the repository.

Since ```kustomize``` is managing all the different project resources - secrets included -, a combination
of ```kustomize``` and ```kubeseal``` is needed for this process.

Starting off by running the command below:

```bash
$ kustomize build .kustomization/overlays/dev/.secrets/
```

This produces a compilation of all the secrets needed in the project, and which need to be sealed individually.
Unfortunately there is no better way to go about this than to execute the following sequence:

```bash
(
ENV="dev"
basedir="$(pwd)/.kustomization"
cd "${basedir}/overlays/${ENV}/"
kustomize build .secrets | yq e 'select(.metadata.name=="'proxy'")' - | kubeseal > sealed-secrets/proxy.yaml 
kustomize build .secrets | yq e 'select(.metadata.name=="'ticket-service'")' - | kubeseal > sealed-secrets/secrets.yaml 
)
```

As a result, all the secrets are now sealed under ```sealed-secrets```, and they can now safely be shared and stored
with no risk of compromising sensitive information.

## Usage

Most systems define a production and development environment. Because each may have specific configurations, an overlay
exists representing each environment: ```prd``` for production and ```dev``` for development.

Based on the target environment, one should use the right overlay.

For instance, to have a development environment running for this service, it would be achieved this way:

```bash
$ kubctl apply -k .kustomization/overlays/dev/
```

Note: it is required to seal the secrets first, as mentioned in [this](#Secret-management) section, before applying
this.

At this point, all the pods should be running (or about to). An example output with default settings:

```bash
$ kubctl get pods
NAME                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS    ...
ticket-api-XXX-XXX          1/1     Running     0           ...
ticket-api-XXX-XXX          1/1     Running     0           ...
ticket-bridge               1/1     Running     0           ...
```
